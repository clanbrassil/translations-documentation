# Trax Translations Documentation

## Guide for Trax Static Translations

This document provides a comprehensive list of static English labels and texts used in the Trax application. It serves as a reference for translators and developers working on localization efforts.

### Current Status

- The list contains approximately 90% of the English content in Trax version 1.
- Many translations have already been implemented based on Clemence's previous work.
- This document is a work in progress and will be updated periodically.

### Content 

The current static text in Trax comes from various sources:
- Decisions made by Alexis or Adam
- Placeholder text for development purposes
- Existing translations compiled by Clemence

### Remaining Work

- Some messages, such as popup titles and notifications, still need to be added to this list.
- Additional content will be added as development progresses.

### Reference Materials

To track the progress of translations and compare with existing work:
1. Cross-reference this list with Clemence's document to check off what has been completed
2. Compare against the live Trax application to ensure consistency with the documentation
3. I beleive Adam will set up a Trax account for Clemence to use as a reference

I think that's is a good starting point!
